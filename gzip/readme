GZIP

steps for compression:
1. read a any data stream in input. let it be a file, a stream, a string from stdin
2. build the gzip header consisting of:
  - ID1: identifies the gzip format, always 0x1F
  - ID2: as ID1, but always 0x8B
  - CM (compression method): which method was used to compress the data, default is DEFLATE algorithm identified as 0x08 
  - FLG (flags): extra optional fields that may be contained in the header
    - bit0 FTEXT file is probably ASCII
    - bit1 FHCRC header CRC is present
    - bit2 FEXTRA extra field is present
    - bit3 FNAME original filename present
    - bit4 FCOMMENT file comment present
    - bit5-7 reserved
  - MTIME (modification time): 4-byte field containing the modification time of the original file. Stored as unix timestamp
  - XLF (extra flags): indicates the level of compression
    - 0x00 default compression
    - 0x02 best compression
    - 0x04 fastest compression
  - OS (operation system)
    - 0 FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT/WIN32)
    - 3 unix
    - 7 macintosh
    - 11 NTFS
    - 255 unknown
