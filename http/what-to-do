Needs to be done in order to implement a web server:

1. Http is based upon TCP, so we'll need to bind to a port and listen to incoming connections
2. Find a way to respond to connections, based on the stuff we need to do.
We should implement a parser to parse the http request, which consists of:
- a start-line: where the protocol, status and the requested resource are requested
- headers: the additional headers that can be attached to the request
- blank line
- an optional body where a client could send its data.
